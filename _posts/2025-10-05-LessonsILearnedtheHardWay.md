title: "From Founder to Leader: Lessons I Learned the Hard Way
---

When I first co-founded my startup, I had no formal experience in leadership. I built a team from scratch — sourcing every early hire through LinkedIn, conducting interviews myself, and making offers based on conviction and chemistry. It was a crash course in leadership, and while we achieved a lot, looking back, there’s so much I would do differently today.

Great bosses aren’t born overnight – they’re shaped by the habits they practice every day. After reflecting on both my own experience and lessons from leadership books, I’ve come to believe in five core practices that truly define great leaders when they’re applied consistently.

### 1. Give Clear Direction

At my startup, I shared a strong vision that attracted incredible people — some joined even when the compensation didn’t match their market value. Our mission was inspiring enough to unite us. But here’s the hard truth: I didn’t revisit that vision often enough.

A compelling vision doesn’t live in a single all-hands or pitch deck. It has to be retold, refined, and reinforced every 90 days so that people don’t just hear it but *own it*. Hearing it once isn’t enough — they need to understand it deeply and connect it to their own goals. I learned this too late, and it’s something I would prioritize if I were leading a team again.

### 2. Provide the Necessary Tools

I always made sure my team had access to resources — GPUs, papers, new frameworks, anything that could help them explore faster. What I overlooked, though, was that *my time* was often the most valuable resource I could give.

Resources like training, technology, and extra help matter – but a leader’s attention matters most. I used to assume casual chats or shared code reviews were enough, but structured one-on-ones might have uncovered deeper needs or bottlenecks. The simplest way to confirm that your team has what they need to do great work? Just ask.

### 3. Let Go

Once expectations are clear and people have what they need, leaders need to resist the urge to micromanage. Early on, I sometimes over-involved myself because the work was deep tech and difficult to measure. In research-driven environments, tangible progress is often fuzzy — you might be “stuck” for weeks, yet still be advancing.

Because I didn’t set clear expectations from the beginning, I found myself constantly clarifying, defending, or justifying the team’s progress to external stakeholders. It drained energy that could have been spent supporting the team. The best lesson I learned: focus on people who understand their roles, genuinely want the responsibility, and have the ability to deliver — then give them space to succeed.

### 4. Act with the Greater Good in Mind

Short-term wins can be tempting, especially under investor pressure. But I’ve learned that when you consistently choose what’s best for the team or organization — even if it’s harder in the short term — you build lasting credibility.

When I had to argue for my team’s value during tough discussions about layoffs, I realized how crucial it is for leadership actions to align with the long-term vision. Acting with integrity and transparency, even under stress, shapes how people remember your leadership long after you leave.

### 5. Set Aside Time to Reflect

In the early days, I was always in execution mode — hiring, coding, firefighting. I rarely paused to step back and reflect. Yet reflection is where real growth happens. Whether it’s a quiet hour each week or a full-day offsite, stepping back helps you see the bigger picture.

I now believe leaders need to *schedule reflection* the way they schedule standups. It’s not indulgence — it’s maintenance for clear thinking and better decisions.



## The Management Habits That Sustain Leadership

Leadership sets the direction, but management keeps the ship steady. Here are five management practices that go hand in hand with leadership — ones I’ve learned both by missing and by doing.



### 1. Set Clear Expectations

I used to assume my team understood priorities and responsibilities intuitively. We were a small, tight-knit group, so I thought shared context was enough. It wasn’t. Without explicit expectations, accountability becomes ambiguous.

People need to know their roles, the values that guide decisions, the priorities that matter most, and the results they’re accountable for. Without clarity in these areas, accountability is impossible.



### 2. Communicate Well

In my first startup, communication often happened informally — over Slack threads or coffee chats. It worked surprisingly well for creativity, but not always for alignment. I learned that great communication isn’t about *talking often*, it’s about *checking for understanding*.

Don’t rely on assumptions – ask questions, listen carefully, and verify mutual understanding. Open dialogue builds trust and ensures that nothing important is left unsaid.

### 3. Establish a Steady Meeting Rhythm

I didn’t set regular one-on-ones officially, though I did have frequent informal discussions. Those casual chats were fantastic for motivation and brainstorming, but they lacked structure. If I could redo it, I’d add a weekly rhythm — team meetings with clear agendas and one-on-ones during the first 90 days for every new hire.

That early attention aligns expectations quickly and prevents misalignment later on.

### 4. Hold Quarterly Conversations

This is one of my biggest takeaways from hindsight. We never had formal quarterly off-sites, and I now realize how powerful they could have been. Meeting off-site, away from daily distractions, to discuss what’s working, what isn’t, and how each person is living up to their role, values, and priorities — that’s where deeper connection and synergy form.

Quarterly conversations keep relationships and goals from fraying, even in fast-moving startups.

### 5. Reward and Recognize

At my startup, we were strong on passion but weak on celebration. Feedback and recognition happened naturally but sporadically. I’ve since seen other teams do this much better — giving quick, public praise and private, constructive feedback within 24 hours.

It’s such a small thing, but consistent recognition creates momentum and trust.

## Building a Culture of Trust and Accountability

Together, these ten practices don’t just create accountability – they shape a culture where trust is reinforced at every level. I’ve experienced what happens when some of these are missing — and how powerful it is when they’re present.

My journey has taken me from founder to leader, and now, back to being a follower in another startup. This transition has taught me that great leadership isn’t about authority — it’s about discipline, clarity, and care.
