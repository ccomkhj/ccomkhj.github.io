title:  Second Thought On Productivity
---

Productivity for me doesn't mean more works get done.
When one can enjoy the journey, then it is truly productive.

Here are a few techniq that helped me enjoy the journey.
1. Mindset shift: Believe that I have fun. Approching things sincerely is more effective than taking things seriously.
2. Turning things to game (Gamification): Dealing things as missions to complete.
3. Bring others on board: Working on a project as a team brings fun
4. Reading into your work: Decide what give the meaning into your life. Fullfilment is one of the key factors to enrich your motivation

When setting up the work environment, it's important to help team truly enjoy their work.
Of course there must be challenging and annoying moments in the journey, but supports as a leader and company and mitigate them.
