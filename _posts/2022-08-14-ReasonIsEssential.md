## Any Lame Excuse is helpful because of "Because justification"

One social experiment showed an interesting outcome.
Even if the reason is the typical cliche or not logical, explaining the reason of your ask is better than nothing.
For example, if you want to cut in line for a copy-machine, tell people please let you cut in line because you should copy.
The likelihood of acceptance is far higher (95% over 51%) than just asking for their consideration.
Another case is, you would be annoyed by the traffic jam, and feel better if you realize the traffic is bad due to the road construction.

## Inspire people by showing the meaning of your work.

Consider the story of two stonemasons. You walk up to the first stonemason and ask, "Do you like your job?" He looks up at you and replies, "I've been building this wall for as long as I can remember. The work is monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be backbreaking. I am not even sure if this project will be completed in my lifetime. But it is a job. It pays the bills. You thank him for his time and walk on. \

About ten meters away, you walk up to a second stonemason. You ask him the same question, "Do you like your job?" He looks up and replies, I love my job. I am building a cathedral. Sure, I have been working on this wall for as long as I remember, and yes, the work is sometimes monotonous. I work in the scorching hot sun all day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day can be backbreaking. I am not even sure if this project will be completed in my lifetime. But I am building a cathedral.
