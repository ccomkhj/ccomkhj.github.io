title: "Job Applications with AI: My Cover Letter Generation Agent"  

---

## The Problem
Writing cover letters sucks. Each one took me 45+ minutes of:

Decoding vague job descriptions + Researching companies + Trying not to sound like a robot
After 10 applications, I was ready to burn my resume. So I built a solution.

## The Build
My AI cover letter generator does what I wish I could:

1. Company Research Agent
2. Scrapes job postings for company names
3. Pulls recent news, products, culture details
4. No more "I admire your innovative culture" BS
5. Multi-Model Brain (GPT-4 for structure, Gemini for facts, Claude for human-like tone)

Self-Editing Workflow: First draft → identifies missing skills → revises
Of course, Outputs clean PDFs ready for upload

## The Results
10x faster: 5 min/application vs 45 min

Higher response rate: 38% callback vs ~10% before

Bonus: Interviews start with "Wow, you really know us"

### Why It Matters
This isn't just about cover letters. It's about:

1. Automating soul-crushing work
2. Using AI as a force multiplier
3. Getting back hours of my life
