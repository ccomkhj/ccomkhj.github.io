title:  How to control your mindset after vacation
---

Vacation is always sweet.
You enjoy the off days and should get back to your life.
Often I felt it is uncomfortable to restart my work life.
It is very likely to happen because my bio-rhythm has changed to another version.
So, it's time to reset the rhythm into the efficient version of handling your work life.
One of my work philosophies is that one could feel the satisfaction of life through fulfilling your standard.

The moment you pass your examination is exciting because this is the result of your fullfiliation.
The moment of hearing "yes" from your life-partner after proposing is exciting for the same reason.

In the usual-days, when you lie on the bed after crossing all TODOs is magnificent since you have made it.
Probably you think that I'm talking about cliche.

Here's the reason why I started this essay.
After the vacation, we are super motivated and want to achieve something big in a short time of period.
But it's ruining your goal setting <> achievement cycle because if the goal is too ambitious, being discouraged is often followed.
So, my advise (or resolution) is that updating the healthy routine but it's not necessarily the challenging one, but keep moving forward every single day.

Writing is a just one step for the long journey, so it's time to behave :)
