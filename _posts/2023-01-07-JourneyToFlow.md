In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. -Wikipedia 

Flow is an amazing state because one can not only complete immense work-loads, but also fulfill the creative works, too.
I could and can jump into the flow state in certain work domains depends on when and what.
When I explore the derivation of mathematics, then I used to lose the track of time.
I'm in another zone and just into mathematics. This is still my joy and I can travel along the flow state.
Also, when I was a newbie in the computer vision domain, when I process images and apply classical and state-of-the-art vision technology to fulfill the task,
it was really fun to test my knowledge from university and research papers.
However, since I have done vision-task hundreds of times already, it doesn't send me to the flow state. 
It becomes somehow boring job because it's easy and only time-consuming.
From another perspective, when I study a new programming language with no background, it requires huge concentration, even if it's one of the great joy in my life.

Based on my journey to be into the flow state,
There are several conditions to reach and retain the flow state.

1. One should have appropriate background/knowledge on the topic. If you know too much, then it becomes your boring job. 
Not too difficult and also not too easy at the same time.

2. You should believe it's meaningful work for you. Apple picking might be not too difficult and also not too easy for me. 
However, I don't find it meaningful to me. So, it doesn't guide me to the flow state

3. Immediate feedback is necessary. If I have to keep writing a pile of code lines, then it won't lead me to the flow state.
I should compile, test, and evaluate my code. After a few trials and errors, I could feel a sense of achievement.
Construc the process to give and get immediate feedback from your/your employee's work.

Everyone pursues happiness in their way. 
Hundreds of research have been studied and books are written.
The key is of course one should have a reliable financial base, which could be your income, savings, or investment because it guarantees your food, clothing, and shelter.
Afterwards, regular transition into the flow state strengthens your life quality.
Moreover, it helps to arise your financial status using your achievement.
