title:  Seeking for Higher
---

Basically people seek for higher.
This tendency is part of human nature. We, as human beings, forget the value of what we have.
Every time we achieve something, we are filled with joy coming from the sense of achievement.
However, this joy does not last long enough.
We need something different and, especially, better.
Where's the concept of the "better" coming from? Who decides if it's better or not in the case of not quantifiable?

A film on Netflix titled 'Hunger' explores this story through the perspective of young cook from the street.
Since we all believe we are special in some sense, she took the offer from a scouter.
I don't blame anyone for seeking to be special.
I somewhat believe that we see ourselves as the hero/heroine of our own story.

I am not going to elaborate all senarios of this movie, so I recommend watching this if you have 2 hours and not sure how to kill it.
In short, movie tells the journey of being successful to professional success and fame. After years of striving, Aoy, who is the heroine, decides to return to her familiy.
It's somewhat of a cliche story if you are looking for a nouveau story.
However, it was a pretty well-made movie that provokes thought.

One question that I have pondered is, "Must we decide only one direction? Can't we achieve both at the same time if we are clever?"
Since I have been working non-stop and missing invaluable opportunities to spend time with family, I might already choose the one-side.
Despite this, I won't forget the value of the other path.
