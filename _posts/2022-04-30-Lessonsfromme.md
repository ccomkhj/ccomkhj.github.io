Predict the direction of my life is quite difficult. Sometimes I wonder if this is the right direction. However, after considering these will be one of subchapters in my life in the macroscopic view, I appreciate the opportunities. <br />

Until 19, I used to live in the country of Korea. Whenever I visited Seoul, I felt something overwhelming because everything is too big and unfamiliar. Once I began studying in SKKU, I had many chances to visit places around Seoul. Then, I realized it is also same where people live. <br />

In the age of 20, I was afraid to serve military service because I have heard about lots of absurdity there. I still remember, though it has been more than 10 years, the day of entering the camp. I was forced to follow disciplines and orders. It was tough, but it was also the place where people live. <br />

After completing my military service of 2 years, I started working in family restaurant; outback steak house. I worked previously as a private tutor because I studied in the prestigious university. I could make money using my privilege, but I decided working as one of average people to experience. It was tough, but it was also the place where people live.  <br />

With my savings from working from outback steakhouse, my first life abroad began in Australia. This time, I was extremely nervous because I have not spoken single English with foreigners. Also, as expected, I could not speak a simple sentence, and also listen a single word. However, time solved my problem by meeting people. I knew nobody there, so went to the Sydney state library and listen ABC radio every 8 hours and started talking to janitor of the library. Long story short, it was also the place where people live. <br />

At the night of Jan, 3, 2016, I could not sleep because tomorrow was my first day of working in Hyundai Mobis. Finally, my status converted from a student to an employee. Facing lots of new people is great as well as demanding. For majorities, I will be only one, but for me, they are almost hundred. Everyday getting to know new colleagues, new supervisors, and new partners. Through a few months, I faced myself who live in the iteration of every day. So, a big company is also the place where people live. <br />

Cutting the similar stories. Coming Germany to study master. Again, the combination of being nervous and excited concluded in realizing that it was also the place where people live. Currently, I am building a company. As far as I felt till today, this is a very different thing because of the infinite future value of my work. Of course, I realize that it will be either zero or one. There are multiple theories to explain the causes of deciding zero or one such as Indefinite/definite optimism/pessimism. I spare my word because I want to open for all possible direction for now. <br />

Every paragraph describes that I had a challenge. Afterwards, I realized again and again that everything is a subchapter of my story. Next life decisions will be affected by this lesson.
