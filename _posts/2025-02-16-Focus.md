title: "Secret to Success: Focus"
---

Throughout my career and learning from other entrepreneurs, I’ve realized failure rarely comes from working hard—it happens when we focus on things that don’t truly matter. Thinking clearly is the first tool to master, and I’ve learned that staying calm is non-negotiable. Anger or panic clouds judgment, which is why I adopted meditation years ago (and why so many successful entrepreneurs swear by it). If there’s one lesson I’d pass on, it’s this: protect your ability to think deeply. Everything else follows from there.

When building teams, I’ve made my share of mistakes. Early on, I rushed hires to fill gaps, only to regret it later. Now I start hiring slowly, even when it’s uncomfortable. Time has taught me that a bad hire costs far more than an empty seat. For tough decisions, I ask myself: “*What’s the worst possible outcome here*?” If I can live with that outcome, I move forward. If not, I rethink. This simple filter has saved me countless sleepless nights.

Want to double your income or business profit? I used to chase every shiny opportunity until I understood the 20/80 rule. Today, I ruthlessly ask: “What one skill, if mastered, would 10x my results?” For me, it was learning to delegate. For you, it might be sales, coding, or design. Distraction is the enemy—focus on the 20% that matters.

Leadership, I’ve noticed, separates those who grow from those who stall. Early in my career, I saw managers waste energy blaming teams for mistakes. Now? I train myself to ask “*How do we fix this?*” the moment a problem arises. Blame kills momentum; solutions build trust.

Above all, I’ve become obsessed with quality. Not perfection—but creating something customers genuinely love. How do I know when I’ve succeeded? When a client recommends it to a friend. That’s the ultimate metric no spreadsheet can capture.
