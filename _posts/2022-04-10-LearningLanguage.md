# My lesson in learning new languages

I am trying to be poly-lingual. \
Most of poly-lingual have childhood background for learning and experiencing multi culture. \
However, I lived until 19 only in one town in South Korea. \
Therefore, my journey to become a multi-language speaker could give lessons to people. \
In this article, my goal is not how to become poly-lingual, but the lessons I had for the last 10 years. \
Prevalent reason of learning new language is to get the better job. \
First and superficial motivation is to submit higher score of English tests and to go through English job interview well. \
However, this is negligible benefit (Iâ€™d say less than 1% of benefit). \
The best advantage of speaking multiple language is *cultural comprehension*. \
Language has developed through human history in the region.  \
Experiencing a language means understanding the mechanism of human itself. \
Ok, this is a quite abstract explanation. \
If you can speak Korean, so first of all I can effectively lower the wall between you and People from Korea.  \
Anytime you watch Netflix movie, you could understand why young people use different gesture and attitude to older.  

I was amazed when I learn new programing languages, too. \
My mother tongue is python, which is interpreter language. \
Benefit of dynamic typing has been so natural to me. \
Once I get to know C, which is compiler language, it introduces me to the world of complex but amazing world of computer. 

## The more I learn about different languages, the more lesson I achieve beyond languages.
