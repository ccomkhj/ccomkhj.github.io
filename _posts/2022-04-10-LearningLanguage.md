# My lesson in learning new languages

I am trying to be poly-lingual. </br>
Most of poly-lingual have childhood background for learning and experiencing multi culture.</br>
However, I lived until 19 only in one town in South Korea.</br>
Therefore, my journey to become a multi-language speaker could give lessons to people.</br>
In this article, my goal is not how to become poly-lingual, but the lessons I had for the last 10 years.</br>
Prevalent reason of learning new language is to get the better job.</br>
First and superficial motivation is to submit higher score of English tests and to go through English job interview well.</br>
However, this is negligible benefit (Iâ€™d say less than 1% of benefit).</br>
The best advantage of speaking multiple language is *cultural comprehension*.</br>
Language has developed through human history in the region. </br>
Experiencing a language means understanding the mechanism of human itself.</br>
Ok, this is a quite abstract explanation.</br>
If you can speak Korean, so first of all I can effectively lower the wall between you and People from Korea. </br>
Anytime you watch Netflix movie, you could understand why young people use different gesture and attitude to older. </br>

I was amazed when I learn new programing languages, too.</br>
My mother tongue is python, which is interpreter language.</br>
Benefit of dynamic typing has been so natural to me.</br>
Once I get to know C, which is compiler language, it introduces me to the world of complex but amazing world of computer.</br>

## The more I learn about different languages, the more lesson I achieve beyond languages.
