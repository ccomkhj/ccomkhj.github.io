title: "Consistency vs The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away"

---

There are two counter arguing saying.
One tells consistency is the secret weapon behind all successful entrepreneur.
One tells meta cognition is important so that one should know when to quit and walk away.
I believe we all observe biased samples, only successful cases of two arguments are visible in public.
Nobody focus on losers: please don't feel offended for the term loser. I strongly believe that sucess comes from many failures. So probably I might have to call temporary loser.
