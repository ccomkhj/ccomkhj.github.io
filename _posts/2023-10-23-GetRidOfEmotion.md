What is the emotion?

At the moment when you are reading this article, you may have some thought and have certain emotion.
We all have experienced some feeling and processed piles of thoughts.

The research of the brain is still covered by veil in most of them.
Researchers barely understand which part of the brain having an electrical reaction happens in which situation.
Also, emotions occur randomly but by a certain mechanism.

I know if I have too many stuffs to deal with, then I am prone to lose my temper and not satisfied what I'm working on.
On the other hand, if I set up regular routines and could follow them, the simplicity gives me a joy.

However, our brain has evolved to seek for changes leading dopamine excess.
All of different circles shape who I am now.

Even though I'm a sane person and work on a same vision, sometime I'm motivated by my circumstances, sometime I'm overwhelmed how many things should be done by me to achieve the goal.

Here's the wisdom of the monks come.
They focus on themselves and understand how they think.
I'd rephrase, they understand what makes their thought.

In this wonderful world where I don't know me and how it works, I will try to forget irrelevant stuff and focus on things meaningful to me.
