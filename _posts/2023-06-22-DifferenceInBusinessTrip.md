title:  What makes difference in Business tip and travel
---

I am writing this blog in the train to Velno, Holland.
It is a business trip to set up the solution in the customer's facility.
Traveling along train inside Europe should be fun but when it comes to be related with business, it becomes stressful.
Is it something I can make better by changing mindset?
If I manage to do mind control, can I enjoy the business trip?
It sounds to be true, but then we need to understand why we believe "travel is fun".

Everytime we imagine a concept, there are abstract images in our mind.
For those who have fears of water, they might imagine floundering inside the water.
On the other hand, for those who like playing inside water, they might imagine swimming and beach volley ball.
So, now, it is clear that what the image of travel determines how you perceive it.
I often think the travel exploring a few new spots with my family or friends.
When I served my military service, I wanted to travel alone.
However, it turns out that I don't normally enjoy traveling alone much because the new places didn't touch my heart.
For me, then it's the question of who you are with.

I believe the conceptualization can apply into multiple domains.
Also, it helps root-cause analysis (RCA).
RCA is not the term only for business analysis.
We can apply this technique to analyze what factors are meaningful in our life.
In the end, we can prioritize something over others.
