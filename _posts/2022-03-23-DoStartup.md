Countless jobs exist in the world. <br> Some work for one of the countless jobs in one’s life, and some work for a few jobs of them. <br>
Another job title, so called entrepreneur, is given when you create more jobs in this world. <br>
If you have a vision to impact the world, then some unsolved problem should be found, validated, and solved by you. <br>
Every single step which you have to make induces pain. <br>
Entrepreneur should have a solid belief that you tackle the right problem, and can lead your business to the sustainable path. <br>
Solid belief doesn’t block all your internal anxiety and opportunity cost of another choice.  <br>

Every entrepreneur deserves the respect of their choice and one’s courage. <br>
However, great courage and will can guarantee only praise, nothing more in the jungle of business. <br>

Every founder of start-ups no matter how they succeeded or failed, once firmly believed their idea, plan, and capability are great. <br>
A founder believes that one is not invested because investors couldn’t understand one’s idea, and vision. <br>
An investor’s job is to understand and appreciate the value and likelihood of success of the business. <br>
With this respect, an investor is more likely to be correct in estimating the success rate. <br>

It doesn’t mean one should be disappointed by the negative feedback, rather regards it as a nutrient to drive oneself toward right direction. <br>
Mentality of reaching for rejections and absorbing feedbacks is bitter but definitely working drugs.
