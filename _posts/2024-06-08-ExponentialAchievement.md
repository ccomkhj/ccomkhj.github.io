title:  Exponential Achievement
---

In the era of the flood of information, we have faced and partially experienced how one can achieve a lot.
I have been a big fan of *Flow* which tells one to focus on limited topics and either learn a lot or achieve a lot.
It could be achieved by limiting distracting factors.

However, since starting the entrepreneur's journey and collaborating/managing teams, my job is not to truly focus on one topic but rather look through multiple aspects and support teams.
In my initial weeks, I didn't feel so great because I couldn't follow my principles; limiting the aspects to consider and emphasizing at very few points.

I believe all life lessons can genuinely come after experiences. 
Looking back over the last few weeks, I *indirectly* achieved significant achievements that will affect the dynamics of the agriculture industry. (Let's see how it goes!)

The word *indirectly* comes because I achieved using less than 10% of my full working time.
Everyone will wonder how? the secret is to build the system to achieve the target.

Choose the (technically, economically) validated target set up the corresponding (real-life) loss function and figure out the (real-life) optimizer.
Find the passionate and better talent who can handle the task well. (Ideally, significantly better, but it's not always the right choice.)
Set up the metric to track if the (business) model is getting close to the target.
Try different methods to reduce the loss. There is no simple SGD, Adam in life, but I could learn at least sub-optimal methods.
Life is the combination of sub-optimal. 
No one knows, proves the optimal life.
