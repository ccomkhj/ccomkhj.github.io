Book summary of starting a talk.

1. Flooding smile
- Have a smile as a default. People approach to you.

2. Sticky eyes
- Staring people's eye even after the speaker stop talking.

3. Hello old friends
- Remember the second time meeting people, and treat them as if old friends.

4. Always wear a whatzit
- Some items to initiate the conversation. Some special small items.

5. Never the naked City/Job
- Don't start with the question "Where are you from?" or "What do you do?"
- This question will be anyway asked to each other. And don't simply saying I'm from korea. I'm a engineer. Flesh it out and try to connect with the situation.

6. Parotting
- Never be speechless again. Like a parrot, repeat the last few words your conversation partner spoke. 

7. Encore
- Tell them about the time you ... . The sweatest sounds a performer hear is the ask of "Encore".

8. Latest news
- Anything happend "today" is a great initiator.
