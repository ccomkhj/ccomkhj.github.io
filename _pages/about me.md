### (want to be) Artist in technology
There are still so many things to improve for the better world.
These are the jobs for artist in tech.

### Want to be a polimath, rather than a specialist.

Interdisciplinary research is a key to accomplish it, but there is limit to achieve it by communicating with experts in another domain.
There are gray areas which could be properly analized and solved, only if one has profound understanding in multiple domains.

I have studied mechanical engineering in college. There I enjoyed understanding fluid dynamics and thermal dynamics.
My first full-time job was in automotive industry, and I developed electricity vehicle system. There I enjoyed developing inverter system, laswer welding and analyzing leakage.
I have studied robotics in master course. There I enjoyed understanding the power of AI and data science.
My first founding company is for the world, and I develop an art to understand plants and to solve the inefficiency of agriculture. There I enjoy all of my work.
