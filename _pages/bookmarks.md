A curated list of interesting links and resources I've found across the web.

## Engineering

**Forecasting**
- [Hyndsight](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/): Blog by Rob Hyndman, a leading expert in time series analysis.
- [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~frederic/415/S23/tsa4.pdf): A comprehensive book for time series analysis.
- [Demand Forecasting for Executives and Professionals](https://dfep.netlify.app/): A compact book focused on demand forecasting.
- [Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd ed)](https://otexts.com/fpp3/): A compact book for time series forecasting.
  - Great content for hierarchical or grouped time series.
  - [Python edition](https://otexts.com/fpppy/nbs/11-hierarchical-forecasting.html)
- [To Explain or to Predict?](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-25/issue-3/To-Explain-or-to-Predict/10.1214/10-STS330.full): Clear distinction between Explanatory and Predictive modeling.
  - [My summary](../_posts/2025-07-16-ExplanatoryvsPredictiveModeling.md)
- [Ranking a Random Feature for Variable and Feature Selection](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume3/stoppiglia03a/stoppiglia03a.pdf): Probes—random variables added to compare feature importance—offer an intuitive feature selection method, but their effectiveness depends on handling correlations and cardinality, making them more common in competitions like Kaggle than in industry for simplicity.
- [A Note on the Validity of Cross-Validation for Evaluating Time Series Prediction](https://www.monash.edu/business/econometrics-and-business-statistics/research/publications/ebs/wp10-15.pdf): if the lag structure of the models is correctly set up (in autoregression models), or, the lag features are created correctly, then **normal k-fold crossvalidation can be used to evaluate** your forecasting models.
- [On Hyperparameter Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms: Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15745): Great summary of how best to optimize hyperparameters based on dataset size and algorithm complexity.


**Machine Learning**
- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://originalstatic.aminer.cn/misc/pdf/Molnar-interpretable-machine-learning_compressed.pdf): the Bible of interpretability. It’s been cited everywhere, even in scikit-learn’s docs.
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf): Essential math (linear algebra, calculus, probability) for ML in an accessible format.
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/NoHesitations/BookAdvanced.pdf): Foundational statistical learning theory and methods, rigorous but dense.
