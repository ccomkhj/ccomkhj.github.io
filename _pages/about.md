Hacker by day, lifelong learner by night.

My polymath journey thrives on daily 1% growth, anchored in:

### Core Pillars

- **Zero to One**: Entrepreneurship
- **Leadership & Feedback**: Radical Candor 
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting
- **Computer Vision**: Extract insights from images
- **MLOps & Data Engineering**: Scratch to Scalable

_Eager to expand this list—and myself—through life's adventures._

### Things I believe

- shipping fast beats waiting for perfection
  - better to iterate quickly, fail fast, and fix than to over-engineer
- pursue truth ruthlessly
  - truth often hurts—but it’s necessary
  - truth comes after a long reflection
- seek and embrace feedback
  - take criticism objectively, without ego
  - give feedback that’s clear, kind, and constructive
  - [radical candor](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Radical-Candor-without-losing-humanity/dp/1509845356)
- leadership is accountability, not authority
  - own outcomes, regardless of title or role
- measure success by quantitative impact
  - it’s often hard to track progress—but what gets measured gets improved
- hard things take time
  - difficult concept to understand? take time to read repeatedly
  - non agreeable opinions? experience it and be in one's shoes.
  - break it down into smaller pieces and tackle them one by one
- customers pay you, not your boss
  - customers tell you what they want, but it's not always what solves their pain
  - be obsessed with finding what really solves their pain
  - seek to understand, not to be understood
