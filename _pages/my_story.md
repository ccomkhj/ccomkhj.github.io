### Embracing Polymathy: A Personal Odyssey into Interdisciplinary Mastery
Choosing the path of polymathy isn't just about engaging in interdisciplinary research; it's a profound exploration of self. While collaboration with experts from diverse domains is undeniably crucial, the essence lies in a more personal revelation.

Within the intricate tapestry of knowledge, understanding oneself becomes the anchor. Navigating through the nuanced gray areas and unraveling complexities requires not only a grasp of various domains but also a deep awareness of personal strengths and limitations.

In this unique journey, the synergy of interdisciplinary expertise and self-discovery is the compass, guiding the polymath through the uncharted territories of comprehensive knowledge. It's not just about mastering diverse fields; it's about an intimate dance between external exploration and internal understanding, creating a truly individualized approach to the pursuit of wisdom.

### Learning is the joy of living. Growing up is the reason for my life. Looking for the opportunity to grow together.

### My journey
Born in South Korea, my journey led me from mechanical engineering at SKKU to serving in the special forces, working in Australian hospitality, and  volunteering to teach math to students from less fortunate families. The turning point came at Hyundai Motors, where I embraced data science in electric vehicle manufacturing.

This experience fueled my pursuit of AI, leading me to Germany's RWTH for a master's in Robotics. Emerging as the NO.1 graduate, I specialized in computer vision. Harnessing this expertise, I co-founded a [startup](https://www.hexafarms.com), which not only thrived in the [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/) program but also raised an impressive 1.2 Million Euros.

Contributing to academia, I published "Deep Aerial Mapper." Simultaneously, my startup achieved a $4k Monthly Recurring Revenue in seven months. Today, my focus is on building a business that matters to the world, leveraging AI for meaningful impact, and exploring collaborative growth opportunities.

[My narrative](https://www.worldjob.or.kr/info/bbs/ovseaAdvnStry/view.do?menuId=1000006395&bbscttNo=192537) has been honored as the top story by the Human Resources Development Service of Korea (HRDK) and is currently featured on their official website.
