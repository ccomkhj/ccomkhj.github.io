Who am I?

### value creator using technology
There are still big rooms for a better world. 

### Want to be a polymath, rather than a specialist.
Interdisciplinary research is a key to accomplishing it, but there is a limit to achieving it by communicating with experts in another domain. \
There are gray areas that could be properly analyzed and solved, only if one has a profound understanding of multiple domains. 

### Learning is the joy of living. Growing up is the reason for my life. Looking for the opportunity to grow together.
