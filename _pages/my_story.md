Who I am?

### (want to be) Artist in technology
There are still so many things to do for the better world. \
I always have many works as an artist.

### Want to be a polymath, rather than a specialist.
Interdisciplinary research is a key to accomplish it, but there is limit to achieve it by communicating with experts in another domain. \
There are gray areas which could be properly analyzed and solved, only if one has profound understanding in multiple domains.
