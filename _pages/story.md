I am obsessed with getting 1% better every day.

Becoming a polymath is the reason behind.

## Things I am proud of

- being a husband and a father
- founded and built [hexafarms](https://www.hexafarms.com) from 0 to 400k ARR and left when it's time for the next step
  - [World Best Accelerator Program: Techstars](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/techstars-berlin_indoorfarms-verticalindoorfarms-foodproduction-activity-6991309954343145472-c1hj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
  - [€1.3M Funding](https://www.eu-startups.com/2024/05/berlin-based-agtech-hexafarms-secures-e1-3-million-pre-seed-to-empower-commercial-indoor-farmers/)
  - [Essay](../_posts/2025-07-15-LessonAfterEndAndBeforeNewStart.md)
- served in the Special Forces and learned what the patience is like
- flew to Australia without money and English knowledge, but finally saved the money for tuition fees
- volunteered as a math teacher for students from less fortunate families
- joined one of the biggest automotive companies (Hyundai Motors) and left when it's time for the next step
- graduated with honors in Mechanical Engineering (BSc) and Robotics (MSc)
- extended master research and published it in the [research paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2410.00769)
- narrated [my story](https://www.worldjob.or.kr/info/bbs/ovseaAdvnStry/view.do?menuId=1000006395&bbscttNo=192537) as the top story

## Things I believe

- shipping fast beats waiting for perfection
  - better to iterate quickly, fail fast, and fix than to over-engineer
- pursue truth ruthlessly
  - truth often hurts—but it’s necessary
  - truth comes after a long reflection
- seek and embrace feedback
  - take criticism objectively, without ego
  - give feedback that’s clear, kind, and constructive
  - [radical candor](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Radical-Candor-without-losing-humanity/dp/1509845356)
- leadership is accountability, not authority
  - own outcomes, regardless of title or role
- measure success by quantitative impact
  - it’s often hard to track progress—but what gets measured gets improved
- hard things take time
  - difficult concept to understand? take time to read repeatedly
  - non agreeable opinions? experience it and be in one's shoes.
- customers pay you, not your boss
  - customers tell you what they want, but it's not always what solves their pain
  - be obsessed with finding what really solves their pain
  - seek to understand, not to be understood
