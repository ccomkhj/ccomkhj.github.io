### Embracing Polymathy: A Journey of Self-Discovery

To become a polymath, I need to understand myself as much as I need to learn new things. Experts from different fields are helpful, but the real work begins with self-assessment.

When I explore new topics, knowing my own strengths and weaknesses is critical. Connecting complex ideas across various subjects demands not just information, but also clear self-awareness and a realistic view of what I can do.

My approach isn't just about gaining skills. It's about combining external learning with internal self-discovery. This blend guides my journey forward. My aim is to gain practical understanding and personal insight, not just facts.

The joy of my life is seeing people happy when they use my product.
